## Intake

What I originally wanted to do is to help people keep a diet journal in a convenient way, by using AI to recognize foods in photos. But I've been thinking about what's the real value of this product as I went through the project. Just convenience? No.

The value is to find how food can affect people's state. And we may boldly expand the domain from 'food' to 'events'. What makes you energetic and what makes you drowsy? What improves your mood and what let you down. The biggest question is there are all those waring equipment that can monitor so many aspects of our body. Why bother falling back to this seemingly outdated way? I've had my answer and I'll answer this soon.
